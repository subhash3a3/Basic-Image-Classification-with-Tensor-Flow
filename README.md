# Basic-Image-Classification-with-Tensor-Flow
This repository consists of the project code and other details which I learnt from coursera project network.

In this project , I Created, trained, and evaluated a Neural Network model that will be able to predict digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy. 

The data set utilised was the MNIST database of handwritten digits, which has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
